I love public speaking and sharing my knowledge with folks all over the world. Whether this is about community building, 
data science and machine learning or other technical topics. 
I am also happy to deliver workshops and tutorials for all ranges of abilities. 

I do have a few requirements for speaking or presenting at your conference or event.
The event must:

- Have an enforceable code of conduct (public and visible and enforcement guidelines)
- Make a best effort to have diverse speakers and participants
